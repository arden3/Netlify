      <h3>FLEXIBLE ARCHITECTURE, FIXED COST, FIXED TIMEFRAME; <br>HIGH-END HOMES BUILT IN JUST 12 WEEKS</h3>
      <p>
        Mondreem modular building systems, is the result of our search for a more innovative, efficient, and sustainable way of building. We build homes in a factory, with the latest technology, with very short lead times and to the highest standards. Following our principles of exclusivity, bespoke design and tailored services, we donÂ´t work with pre-designed models. Each project is designed following every client's specific requirements, taking into consideration passive design principles, hence providing complete freedom in design, finish and equipment options.

        <h4>FIXED COST</h4>
        <p>
          Due to the way we design, build and deliver our projects, we require full design resolution and documentation before we undertake any project. This enables us to provide our clients with the exact cost of materials and man hours before we start the construction process.

        <h4>YOUR PROJECT BUILT IN A FACTORY</h4>
        <p>
          Our modular buildings are constructed in a controlled industrial environment, allowing for a highly planned and design led process. The combination of modularisation and prefabrication technologies for the different components and systems of the project allows us to build high quality buildings way faster than with traditional methods, while maintaining the highest standards of quality.

        <h4>CUSTOM TO YOUR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS</h4>
        <p>
          While we use modularisation technologies, each modular project is custom designed to suit your spatial requirements and site requirements. Our modules are made from fully welded structural steel frames with no set size or shape for our modules, as all modules are customised to suit each project.

        <h4>BUILD IN LESS TIME</h4>
        <p>
          Your modular home will be built within 12 weeks after the completion of  the architectural and design project. Our unique construction process combines modularisation and prefabrication to create a degree of automation that cannot be achieved with on-site construction methods. The risk of weather and site delays is eliminated, allowing for a fixed timeline for construction.

        <h4>PREMIUM & SUSTAINABLE</h4>
        <p>
          Our modular-build homes are build using only products of the highest quality, placing special emphasis on materials that are recyclable, eco-friendly and sustainably sourced.
          This is why we use a structural steel frame and structural insulated panels that can be recycled at the end of their lifecycle. Building the projects inside a factory reduces site waste and the environmental impact associated with traditional construction methods, while allowing us to better control the recycling of any waste material created during the building process.

          Our handcrafted interiors have been exclusively tailored by expert hands to the highest levels of quality and attention to details.
          The materials used in Spacio Forma homes are meticulously selected to build homes with the ultimate level of comfort, and quality.
