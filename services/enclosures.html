      <h3>TOTAL FACADE SOLUTION: DESIGN, ENGINEERING, FABRICATION, INSTALLATION</h3>
      <p>
        Offering a complete solution approach, we take care of everything, from design, fabrication and installation of complex facades with the integration of multiple systems and materials. Thanks to integrating design, engineering and fabrication under one roof, we are able to create complete façade solutions that strike balance between aesthetics, performance and build quality. Each solution responds to the individual requirements of the project, and unlike other façade suppliers, we have the flexibility to work on small private projects as well as larger operations, with multiple materials and systems. As a one single source solution provider, every project is followed closely by our project managers from early stages until completion, in order to meet the highest standards of quality and service.

        <h4>GLASS FACADES</h4>
        <p>
          Glass facades and curtain walls are widely used facade technologies for cladding large areas of a building. We have a flexible design approach that selects the best solution to meet the specific project requirements. If needed, we also develop bespoke solutions.<br><br>
          -	Aluminum transom-mullion systems<br>
          -	Structural glazing<br>
          -	Steel-glass facades<br>
          -	Ventilated curtain wall

        <h4>MODULAR FACADES</h4>
        <p>
          Modular facades are an optimal solution for high-speed, high-quality facades, while being tailored to the individual requirements of the project. This facade combines good engineering with a high degree of prefabrication in a controlled facility to minimize the installation works on the construction site. Mondreem modular façades can also be combined seamlessly with other façade systems.<br><br>
          -	Curved or tilted facades<br>
          -	Combination of different materials and glass types<br>
          -	Large module dimensions<br>
          -	Integration with sun protection and sound insulation systems
