      <h5>Designers, developers, home builders</h5>
      <p>
        <br /><br />
        Mondreem is an international design and development firm, specialized in
        creating luxury homes, high-end boutiques and bespoke furniture.
        <br /><br />
        Since its inception, Mondreem constantly redefined the impact that
        design has on the places we live in by building spaces that evoke
        emotions and enhance the quality of living.
        <br /><br />
        Our expertise extends across the areas of development management,
        architecture, interior design and specialty construction. In addition,
        as a result of years of experience in bespoke furniture design and
        manufacturing, we have created a collection of fine crafted furniture
        and exclusive products that complement our projects.

          As a multidisciplinary firm we integrate our team of designers,
          architects, engineers, project managers and construction specialists

        <h5>Complete solution</h5>
        <p>
          The range of services and products that we offer goes beyond the ones
          offered by traditional architecture and design firms. The integration
          of our design studio with the design-build division allows us to take
          care of the entire process from early stages of design to completion.

        <h5>Technology & Materials</h5>
        <p>
          Delivering exceptional projects require working closely with leading
          materials and building systems manufacturers. At Mondreem we cooperate
          with leading building suppliers in order to provide our clients with
          the latest solutions available in the market.
