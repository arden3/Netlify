      <h3>Park Twin Tower</h3>
      <p>
        The elliptical shape of the towers creates unique spaces for the
        residents, while maximizing the views towards the national park of
        Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. The development will feature high-end apartments
        with indoor pool, fitness and spa centre, as well as indoor shopping
        streets in the first three floors to allowing the residents a retreat
        from the city life.
